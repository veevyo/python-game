# blockrush
I originally used a tutorial to make this game, but have since made a lot of changes. The original tutorial is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8n91btt5d8.

I've called it blockrush. You use all 4 arrow keys to move. Avoid the red blocks or else you will lose the game. The game gradually gets faster (and, therefore, harder) as your score increases.
